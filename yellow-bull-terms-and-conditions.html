            <p><strong>2. For Yellowbull Merchants (“Merchants”)</strong></p>
            <p>As a Merchant, in addition to provisions applicable to Partners in general and other terms or contracts which you have entered into with Yellowbull, you are subject to the additional terms below.</p>
            <p><strong>2.1.1</strong> <strong>Creation and Monitoring of Self-funded Marketing Activities</strong></p>
            <p>You may be able to create a campaign, participate in promotion or place an order for advertisement(s) on the Platform PROVIDED ALWAYS THAT you agree to bear any and all costs or expenses which may arise in connection with the campaign, promotion and/or advertisement (“<strong>Marketing Activity(ies)</strong>”). In creating or otherwise indicating consent to participate in a Marketing Activity, you may be required to indicate information such as the type of Marketing Activity, budget for the Marketing Activity and/or the proposed duration for the Marketing Activity. The types of Marketing Activities which you may choose from the Application may be varied from time to time at Yellowbull’s sole discretion, and where provided, suggested or offered, you agree and acknowledge that they are made available on an ‘as-is’ basis.</p>
            <p>By creating or participating in any Marketing Activities, you accept the following additional general conditions:</p>
            <p>(a) Any information submitted through your account to us (whether via our Application or otherwise), including without limitation the submission of your consent to participate in a Marketing Activity and acceptance of the applicable terms, shall be deemed to have been submitted by you, regardless of whether they are submitted on your behalf by your employee or other individuals. You are solely responsible to ensure that only authorized individuals have access to your account.</p>
            <p>(b) Any information you input into the Platform where required or otherwise provided to us must be complete, truthful, accurate and not misleading.</p>
            <p>(c) Your intention to create or otherwise indicate consent to participate in a Marketing Activity must be genuine and must not be conducted in a manner which may be misleading to the Consumers. You shall indemnify us in the event where we incur any losses or damages arising from or in connection with the Marketing Activity.</p>
            <p>(d) Depending on the type of Marketing Activity elected by you, the way in which we may facilitate the Marketing Activity may differ. You agree that it is your responsibility to review any and all information made available by us to understand  how each type of Marketing Activity will be facilitated. If you have any enquiries, you agree that you are responsible to clarify the same with our personnel before creating or otherwise indicating consent to participate in a Marketing Activity. By creating or otherwise indicating consent to participate in a Marketing Activity, you irrevocably agree to the way in which the Marketing Activity will be facilitated.</p>
            <p>(e) You shall be responsible to directly handle any complaints or enquiries from Consumers in respect of the Marketing Activity.</p>
            <p>(f) In the event where you would like to end, pause or otherwise vary a Marketing Activity (for example, where the discounted item under the Marketing Activity has become out of stock prior to expiry of the said duration, where you would like to cancel the Marketing Activity or vary the budget indicated for the Marketing Activity), you must immediately indicate the same via our Application or otherwise in accordance with the process as may be specified by us. Prior to the completion of the said process, you remain liable to bear any and all costs or expenses incurred in connection with the Marketing Activity and remain responsible to handle any enquiries or complaints from Consumers in respect of or in connection with the Marketing Activity.</p>
            <p>(g) Notwithstanding any provision otherwise and in any event, your creation or indication of consent to participate in a Marketing Activity does not indicate our approval that the Marketing Activity is in accordance with the applicable law. You agree that you are solely and entirely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of the information submitted to us and to ensure that the Marketing Activity is, and will be conducted, in accordance with the applicable law.</p>
            <p>(h) While we do not supervise or monitor the Marketing Activity, we reserve the rights to (but are not obliged to) cancel, take down, suspend or otherwise vary the Marketing Activity as we deem fit, without being liable for any damage or loss whatsoever, including any refund of the fee or cost which you have paid for the purposes of the Marketing Activity.</p>
            <p>(i) We may make available to you information relating to the Marketing Activity, and such information is considered as part of the Platform Content and is subject to Clause 28.2 of Section A.</p>
            <p>(j) You agree to pay to Yellowbull any and all costs and expenses in connection with the Marketing Activity. Notwithstanding any other provisions, you authorise Yellowbull and its affiliates to directly deduct any amount payable by you to Yellowbull or its affiliates, including without limitation the said costs and expenses in connection with the Marketing Activity (“<strong>Amount Payable</strong>”), from any amount receivable by you as a Partner (including without limitation your balance in the merchant wallet on the Platform) (“<strong>Amount Receivable</strong>”) prior to crediting the Amount Receivable to the bank account(s) which you have instructed Yellowbull or its affiliates to transfer the Amount Receivable to. We reserve the right to change the payment method or otherwise set off the Amount Payable against your Amount Receivable by providing reasonable notification to you, or to issue an invoice for the Amount Payable where we deem appropriate.</p>
            <p>(k) You must notify us immediately if your account has been used without your authorization to create or otherwise indicate consent to participate in a Marketing Activity or where any other breach of security has occurred. In such an event, you agree to indemnify us for any losses or damages that we incur as a result of the unauthorized use (including but not limited to bearing the costs or expenses which have been incurred due to the Marketing Activity created or launched using your account). For the avoidance of doubt, we will not be liable for any losses that you incur as a result of someone else using your account.</p>
            <p>(l) You agree that any amount payable to you by Consumers for each Goods Order placed pursuant to the Marketing Activity may be rounded in accordance with our internal policies which we may update from time to time.</p>
            <p><strong>2.1.2</strong> <strong>Submission and Variation of Content</strong></p>
            <p>We do not claim ownership of any content or information that you upload on the Platform or otherwise supply us with. Where you upload or provide us with any content that is covered by intellectual property rights (including without limitation photos or videos), you (a) grant us a non-exclusive, royalty-free, transferable, sub-licensable, worldwide, perpetual license to host, use, distribute, modify, run, copy, publicly perform or display, translate, and create derivative works of your content; and (b) undertake that you have the right to grant us such licence.</p>
            <p>We may enable you to vary or amend the content or information submitted by you to us (including without limitation information relating to the menu) or certain content submitted by Consumer(s) in order to facilitate the Solution including without limitation detail(s) of an order placed by a Consumer. You acknowledge that any such content or information may be made available in real time to end consumers via the Platform or otherwise, and undertake that you will (and shall be responsible) to handle any complaints or queries by the Consumer(s) in respect of the said content or information without incurring liability on our part. We may, but are not obliged to, review the content or information submitted or amended by you (via the Platform or otherwise) from time to time, and reserve the rights to remove or require amendments to any part of the content or information submitted by you where we deem necessary. For the avoidance of doubt, you shall at all times, ensure that the content or information submitted are not in contravention with the applicable laws and do not infringe any third party rights. In the event where you amend any content submitted by Consumer(s) such as an order placed by a Consumer, you further agree that by amending such content, (1) you have obtained the prior consent or acceptance from the affected Consumer; and (2) Yellowbull is not involved in and will not be responsible for the amendments made by you, though Yellowbull reserves the right to (but is not obliged to) carry out Rectification Measure(s) to correct the amendment(s) made or otherwise resolve dispute or complaint arising from or in connection with the amendment(s) made.</p>
            <p><strong>2.1.3 Merchant Access to Yellowbull Platforms</strong></p>
            <p>Where you are a Merchant, Yellowbull may allow you to access, view, retrieve, disclose, manage and/or otherwise use (“<strong>Use</strong>”) information relating to the Service, Solutions and/or other confidential details of your business or relationship with Yellowbull (“<strong>Business Information</strong>”) via a user account(s) on the Platform(s) (“<strong>Account(s)</strong>”) as well as to enable other person(s), be it a natural or legal person, authorized by you, your personnel via email correspondence or otherwise confirmed in accordance with the provisions of the separate agreement that you have entered into with Yellowbull (“<strong>Merchant</strong> <strong>Authorized User(s)</strong>”), to Use the same via separate Account(s). In such an event, you agree that:</p>
            <p>(a) You shall ensure that yourself and each Merchant Authorized User accept and comply with any and all terms, guidelines and policies that are applicable to access or use of the Account(s) and the relevant Platform(s), which may be updated from time to time. This includes without limitation the provisions made available herein, which the Merchant Authorized Users shall comply with as if they are ‘you’.</p>
            <p>(b) You are solely responsible to ensure that each Merchant Authorized User has the necessary rights to Use the Business Information; and shall provide Yellowbull with a written notice at least thirty (30) days prior to the termination or expiry of your relationship with the Merchant Authorized User(s); or where any Use by the Merchant Authorized User(s) shall be terminated or suspended for any reason(s). Without prejudice to any other provisions, you acknowledge that pursuant to operational or technical limitations, Yellowbull and/or its affiliate(s) may not be able to terminate or suspend the Merchant Authorized User’s Use in time, in which case, you shall prohibit the Merchant Authorized User(s) from continuing to Use the Account, Business Information, Platform or any part thereof by other means; and Yellowbull and its affiliate(s) shall never be held liable in any manner for the same.</p>
            <p>(c) All information that Yellowbull and its affiliate(s) makes available, including without limitation the Business Information, are on an “as is” basis and Yellowbull and its affiliate(s) do not give any warranties or representations (express or implied, and whether on their own behalf or that of their respective directors, officers, employees, agents or advisers) with regard to the accuracy, quality, timeliness, reliability or completeness of the same. You are responsible to make your own evaluation of the information.</p>
            <p>(d) You are solely responsible for each Merchant Authorized User’s Account(s) as well as their respective Use of the Business Information, Account(s) and the Platform(s); and Yellowbull and its affiliates shall not be liable for any losses that you incur as a result of the same.</p>
            <p>(e) Yellowbull reserves the right, but is not obliged, to require you to provide information on your relationship with each Merchant Authorized User; and to, at its sole absolute discretion, impose additional conditions for the Use or the Platform(s), such as a requirement that an additional fee be paid for the Use, Platform(s) or any part thereof; or terminate or suspend any Merchant Authorized User’s access to the Account(s) and/or Platform(s).</p>
